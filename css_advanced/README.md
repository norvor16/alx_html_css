- Fonts to install:

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

````

2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the project.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
* Google Fonts
* Figma (for UI/UX design reference)

## 💡 Notes

* If some values appear in float in Figma (e.g., `32.13px`), feel free to round to the nearest pixel.

3. Integrate any animations or transitions as specified in the design.
4. Ensure responsiveness using media queries.
